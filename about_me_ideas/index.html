<p>I began programming in high school, during this time I took a few courses in HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS. However, I was more interested in playing sports and enjoying my teens.</p>
<p>I joined a rock climbing team and focused on sponsorships, competing, and spending time outdoors. My biggest accomplishment in climbing was placing first at the 2015 Divisional Sport Climbing Championship and fourteenth at the National Sport Climbing Championship in Keneesaw Georgia later that season.</p>
<p>In college I pursued a biology degree with plans to be a physical therapist. At this time I started working at a physical therapy clinic but soon realized that this wasn't the job I wanted.</p>
<p>I found my way back to software development and started studying online, soon I found out that I had a real passion for development. After a couple months went by I realized that I needed to go to school, I loved learning but felt stagnated going about it alone. I enrolled in a few programming courses in college but became disheartened at the slow pace, I was hungry for more and decided I was going to get it. I loved the problem solving, the required attention to detail, thinking about efficiency and best coding practices but most of all I enjoyed the building and creating. I became addicted to the power of computers and the amazing things they do at lightning fast speeds. I then enrolled in learningFuze, a time tested accelerated web development program in the the heart of Orange County. I learned how to collaborate and work on a team, the simulated work environment and fast pace made it feel like a real workplace. It's been a long journey but after spending over six hundred hours over the course of three months at learningFuze I'm more excited than ever to join the workforce and develop the next generation of greatness.</p>

            <p>Memory match is a memory game in which the user attempts to gain more nuclear resources
            than the AI to ensure nuclear domination. I built out most of the game using core JavaScript. This was my first attempt at including a computer player in one of my games;
            it was an enormous undertaking that taught me a lot about slowing a computer turns down to human speed.
            I also made this game without relying on bootstraps styles and modal feature. While this challenged
            my skills as a developer it was a great journey from start to finish. Enjoy!</p>

# Guessing Game

An interactive guessing game that has an interesting CSS effect. The background image that is selected before the start of the users turn gets chosen randomly from an array of images in a way that prevents users from getting the same image twice until they have gone through all the images. Structured with MVC this was a strong dive into the world of object oriented programming. This project also features multiple languages that users can play in.

# Taco'bout It

This repo is a web application created by a team of four during a full immersion web development program's hackathon. We were tasked to utitilize at least three distinct APIs in a web application in span of 36 hours.

## Feature List
- Combined 4 **external API resources** via **AJAX** requests and present their information in an application
  - Google Maps API
  - Google Places API
  - Taco Recipe API
  - Google Image Search API
- Organized our application with **Model, View, Controller** architectural pattern
- Documented loosely on JSDOC standards
- Project Team Management Tasks with Meistertask

## Implemented
- **API AJAX Requests**
- **MVC** : Code properly formatted in MVC, variables and functions well define and documented
- **Mobile Responsive** Design: Created a Web App with mobile-first approach
- **UI / UX** : Simple and Intuitive UX
- Task / Issue Management  : Development process documented, controlled, and delegated.  We had well-defined issues, milestones, and project management
